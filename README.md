# Chatbot Application

This is a simple chatbot application built with JavaScript and OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## Description

This application allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. Users can input messages into the chat interface, and the chatbot will respond with generated text based on the input.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have obtained an API key from OpenAI and replaced `"redacted"` with your actual API key in the code.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Type messages into the input field and press Enter to send them to the chatbot.

## How It Works

- The application uses JavaScript to send messages to the OpenAI API and retrieve responses from the GPT-4 model.
- Messages are sent to the API using the `fetch()` function with the appropriate authorization headers.
- The chat interface displays both user messages and responses from the chatbot.

## Installation

No installation is required to run this application. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Dependencies

This application requires access to the OpenAI API. Ensure you have obtained an API key and replaced `"redacted"` with your actual API key in the code.
